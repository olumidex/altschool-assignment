              My name is Olumide (#Omidev), i have always been passionate about
              technology and design. Ever since i was young, i loved tinkering
              with computers and creating visually appealing projects. As i grew
              older, i realized that my interests aligned perfectly with the
              field of frontend engineering, where i could combine my technical
              skills with my eye for design to build engaging and user-friendly
              web applications. Determined to turn my passion into a career, so
              i began researching educational programs that could provide me
              with the necessary skills and knowledge. After considering several
              options, i discovered Altschools. The comprehensive curriculum,
              experienced instructors, and hands-on learning approach
              immediately caught my attention..
